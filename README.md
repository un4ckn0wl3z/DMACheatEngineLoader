# DMACheatEngineLoader

This project simplifies the process of enabling DMA support for Cheat Engine.  Instead of complex configurations, you can achieve DMA compatibility by simply copying your existing Cheat Engine installation into the provided `DMACE` folder.

## Description

DMACheatEngineLoader streamlines the process of adding Direct Memory Access (DMA) capabilities to Cheat Engine. It eliminates the need for manual setup and configuration, allowing users to leverage DMA functionality with minimal effort.  This is achieved by providing a pre-configured environment within the `DMACE` folder.

## Features

* **Easy Installation:**  Just copy your existing Cheat Engine installation into the `DMACE` folder.
* **Simplified DMA Support:** Enables DMA functionality for Cheat Engine with minimal configuration.
* **Pre-configured Environment:**  The `DMACE` folder contains the necessary files and structure for DMA support.

## Installation

1. **Install Cheat Engine:** Ensure you have a working installation of Cheat Engine.
2. **Copy Cheat Engine:** Copy the *entire* contents of your Cheat Engine installation directory into the `DMACE` folder provided in this repository.  Overwrite any files if prompted.  The structure inside the `DMACE` folder should mirror your original Cheat Engine installation.
